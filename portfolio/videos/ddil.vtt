00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.466
When performing a typical doubling
dilution, begin with five empty tubes

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:08.866
labeled as shown, ready to prepare
five dilutions of a patient's sample.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.900
Each sample in this sequence of dilutions
will be double

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.800
the dilution of the previous one.

5
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.633
Note that microplates can also be used

6
00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:19.866
to perform the doubling dilution process.

7
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.300
However, this video will demonstrate

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.133
how to perform this process with test tubes.

9
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:29.400
Add 200 microlitres of saline
to each of the tubes.

10
00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.666
Ensure that you also have the patient's
sample ready.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.600
Using a pipette, transfer 200 microlitres of patient sample
to the first tube and mix.

12
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.033
The plasma could come
from a primary patient's sample

13
00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.100
or a plasma subsample.

14
00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.166
Then, transfer
200 microlitres of dilution 2

15
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.566
to the next tube down the line and mix.

16
00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:55.200
Do the same for dilution 8,

17
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.933
dilution 16,

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.100
and finally, dilution 32.

19
00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:07.366
You now have a series of dilutions
of your original sample.

20
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.800
The original sample is generally referred
to as the “neat sample,”

21
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.133
“the neat dilution,” or just “neat.”
In scientific publications,

22
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.400
you may see it referred to as “1.”

23
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.600
The last sample in the dilution sequence

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.200
will have double the volume
of the other dilutions.

25
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:30.600
In this example,
the 32 dilution contains 400 microlitres,

26
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.666
while the other dilution tubes contain
200 microlitres.

27
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.833
If your initial testing regime fails
to reach an end point -

28
00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:43.433
- the dilution after which an antibody
can no longer be unequivocally detected -

29
00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:47.800
- you should always have enough diluted
sample to continue the dilution process.

30
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.233
Continuing the dilution process from 32
will increase

31
00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:57.866
the dilution factors to 64, 128,
and so on.
