							<h1>| Doubling Dilution</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p class="content">I was tasked with designing and developing a set of five digital educational modules regarding knowledge and practice in immunohaematology settings. One module required information regarding techniques to be accurately but accessibly transmitted, including a technique called “doubling dilution” (i.e., taking a patient’s sample of blood and diluting this by a factor of two each time).</p>
							<h2>Approach</h2>
							<p class="content">Through liaison and co-production with Subject Matter Experts, I ascertained that the technique could be presented in a generic manner with digital tools. However, given the small levels of sample used in this technique (e.g., as small as 200μL), it would be difficult to film a scientist performing this technique. I therefore created a storyboard of the process and identified how this could be turned into alternative content.</p>
							<h2>Solution</h2>
							<p class="content">Using a combination of Adobe Photoshop (for static PNG and SVG resources), After Effects (to add movement to these statis resources) and Premiere Pro (to compose, align narration and create subtitles), I develop an animation of the doubling dilution process. I called on a number of animation principles for this activity, particularly <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959475212001004" target="_blank">cueing and anti-cueing</a>, to ensure that learners’ visual attention was subtly guided during learning to most effectively enhance comprehension.</p>

							<h2>Impact</h2>
							<p class="content">The animation was distributed to other scientists who commended its ability to visually extrapolate a delicate process into something that was quick to comprehend and requested further processes to be animated in the same way. Furthermore, when sharing with my team in digital education, I explained how to create, modify, adjust and export subtitles using Adobe Premiere Pro. This led to an improvement in the team’s offering and abilities.</p>
