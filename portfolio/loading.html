							<h1>| Preloader</h1>
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p class="content">Several digital resources embedded within a health organisation’s learning modules were relatively memory- and bandwidth-intensive. This meant that resource loading times were often longer than desired, which led to a ‘break’ in the user experience and immersion of the learner, and on occasion, learners skipping content and no visual cue was present.</p>
							<h2>Approach</h2>
							<p class="content">To allow for visual and experiential continuity, I researched and tested some initial ideas for a preloader to appear while more resource-intensive content loaded in the background. As such, it would need to be visually in-line with the branding of the learning, engaging enough to identify that a process was occurring in the background, but not so large that it could not be rapidly loaded, and therefore defeating its purpose.</p>
							<h2>Solution</h2>
							<p class="content">I used Adobe After Effects to combine and animate several shapes and SVG files in a simple yet engaging way. Once output as a composed GIF, I placed this into the coding of the modules to allow it to appear while the main content loaded ‘behind’ this. The full animation sequence was 10 seconds and I designed it such that a seamless loop could occur should loading times take longer than this (e.g., due to low bandwidth).</p>

							<div id="fignote-wrap">
								<blockquote>The preloader in loop mode. The colours and imagery were chosen to fall in line with the organisation's branding guidelines and purpose.</blockquote>
							</div>
							<h2>Impact</h2>
							<p class="content">Learners reacted positively to the use of this preloader and resources were no longer skipped. This strategy was also adopted in other modules, and I gave a series of short tutorials on how to use After Effects to produce this and similar preloaders.</p>
